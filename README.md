This script exists as a template I created to help me make changes I grow tired of doing repeatedly in Unity or to optimize load times.
- Have a need for all of a specific object to be in an array, use this script to do that and destroy the tedium!
- Have a ton of objects that each need to be hooked up in a specific way, use this script to do that so you or world devs you're helping don't have to!
- Using a Start function that doesn't absolutely require running at runtime, use this script to save on load times for your players!

I have marked where to start building your code in the script to hopefully streamline its implementation.
